# Consolidation of developed machine learning projects

In this repository are grouped the data analysis and Machine Learning projects developed by me.

Most projects have developed to broaden my knowledge in data analysis and machine learning. Others were projects that I developed in a secondary way to assist in research related to mechanical vibrations.

Each project presents its own 'readme.md' to explain in detail the context of the project and what is expected as a result of the analysis.
