# Exploring NASA's turbofan dataset

Although released over a decade ago, NASA's turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset (CMAPSS) remains popular and relevant today. Over 90 new research papers have been published in 2020 so far [1]. These papers present and benchmark novel algorithms to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) on the turbofan datasets.

This project will be a series of eight parts, consisting of the following steps:

1 - Exploratory data analysis and baseline model;

2 - Updated assumption of RUL & Support Vector Regression;

3 -  Time series analysis: distributed lag models;

4 -  Survival analysis for predictive maintenance;
5 - Random forest;

6 - Reproducible results primer for NNs;

7 - Lagged MLP & condition based normalization;

8 - LSTM & wrap-up;
